This notebook demonstrates a simple ensemble method for ranking problems. It is based on the two incredible notebooks:

Stronger baseline with code cells by suicaokhoailang

AI4Code Pairwise BertSmall inference by yuanzhezhou

All credits for the models themselves (both training and prediction) belogs to the original authors! I simply cloned their code and retrained my own version.
